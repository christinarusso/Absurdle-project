"""the idea behind this is:
- there are a number of wordlists of equal length and one is chosen randomly per game (/can pick random section of words) - a section of words from the wordlist are picked randomly
- you start with a score of 100
- you can adjust difficulty by chosing a longer list of words : beginner mode = 100 words, intermediate mode = 200 words, advanced mode = 300 words - each file will have 500 words
- -10 for each guess you need to make
- hints: you can chose n number of words that you want to compare the future biggest bucket for resulting from picking that word but for each word you 
  -5 from overall score"""
